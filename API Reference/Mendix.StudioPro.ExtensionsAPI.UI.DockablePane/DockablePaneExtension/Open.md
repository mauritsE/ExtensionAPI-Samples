# DockablePaneExtension.Open method

Create [`DockablePaneViewModelBase`](../DockablePaneViewModelBase.md) when a pane is opened.

```csharp
public abstract DockablePaneViewModelBase Open()
```

## Remarks

This method is called every time when the pane is opened. Note that the pane can be opened automatically on extension load, if it has been previously opened by Studio Pro user.
