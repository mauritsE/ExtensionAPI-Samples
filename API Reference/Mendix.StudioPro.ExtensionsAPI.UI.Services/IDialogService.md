## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CloseDialog](IDialogService/CloseDialog.md)(…) | Closes a modal dialog previously opened from the [`ShowDialog`](./IDialogService/ShowDialog.md) method. It returns errors if trying to close a dialog that was not previously opened or that has already been closed. |
| [ShowDialog](IDialogService/ShowDialog.md)(…) | Shows a modal dialog based on the passed [`ModalDialogViewModelBase`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.Dialogs/ModalDialogViewModelBase.md). The [`ModalDialogViewModelBase`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.Dialogs/ModalDialogViewModelBase.md) dialog is currently only allowed to be created by implementing the abstract class [`WebViewModalDialogViewModel`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.Dialogs/WebViewModalDialogViewModel.md), which will allow using a [`IWebView`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.UI.WebView/IWebView.md) inside a modal dialog. |
