# IModel.StartTransaction method

Starts a transaction which wraps model changes.

```csharp
public ITransaction StartTransaction(string description)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| description | Description of the operation performed on the model. This description is visible to Studio Pro user in Edit -&gt; Undo menu. |

## Return Value

[`ITransaction`](../ITransaction.md) representing the transaction.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *description* is null or empty. |
| InvalidOperationException | Another transaction is already running. |

## Remarks

Any modification to the model must be done within a transaction otherwise a InvalidOperationException is thrown. There can be only a single active (i.e. not committed or rolled back) [`ITransaction`](../ITransaction.md) for the whole app. Transactions do not isolate changes, but group them. Thus, any change to a model is immediately visible to all code working with the model. When a transaction is rolled back, all changes are reverted.

## Examples

Please see the following example showing a way to modify the StudioPro model structure in a transaction:

```csharp
using (var transaction = model.StartTransaction("rename folder"))
{
    folder.Name = "New_Name";
    transaction.Commit();
}
```
