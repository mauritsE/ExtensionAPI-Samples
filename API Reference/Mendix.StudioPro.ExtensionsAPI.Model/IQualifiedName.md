# IQualifiedName interface

Represents a [by-name reference](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/mxsdk/understanding-the-metamodel#3-1-references) to an object (element or unit) in metamodel. The type of the referenced object is not statically known.

```csharp
public interface IQualifiedName : IEquatable<IQualifiedName>
```

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [FullName](IQualifiedName/FullName.md) { get; } | Fully qualified name of the referenced object. For example `MyFirstModule.MyHomePage`. |
| [Name](IQualifiedName/Name.md) { get; } | Name of the referenced object. For example `MyHomePage`. |

## Remarks

Apps can contain invalid references, for example references to objects removed from the app. Such references are called invalid and they cannot be resolved even if an object they point to still exists in Studio Pro's memory.
