## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateMicroflow](IMicroflowService/CreateMicroflow.md)(…) | Creates a microflow and adds it to its containing folder. It initializes it with start and end nodes and the specified *parameters*. It uses ReturnType property of [`IMicroflow`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.Microflows/IMicroflow.md) to set the Return Type and its value, using the [`MicroflowReturnValue`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.Microflows/MicroflowReturnValue.md) parameter./&gt;. The microflow must be added to the app model first before this method can be used. |
| [GetAllMicroflowActivities](IMicroflowService/GetAllMicroflowActivities.md)(…) | Get all activities of a microflow that are exposed as [`IActivity`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.Microflows/IActivity.md) in the API, including nested activities (loop). Order and nesting of activities cannot be determined from the result. |
| [GetParameters](IMicroflowService/GetParameters.md)(…) | Get all parameters of a microflow. |
| [Initialize](IMicroflowService/Initialize.md)(…) | Initializes an empty microflow with start and end nodes and the specified *parameters*. It uses ReturnType property of [`IMicroflow`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.Microflows/IMicroflow.md) to set the Return Type./&gt;. The microflow must be added to the app model first before this method can be used. |
| [IsVariableNameInUse](IMicroflowService/IsVariableNameInUse.md)(…) | It verifies if variable name has already been used in the [`IMicroflow`](../Mendix.StudioPro.ExtensionsAPI.Model.Microflows/IMicroflow.md). |
| [TryInsertAfterStart](IMicroflowService/TryInsertAfterStart.md)(…) | Inserts *activities* in the microflow directly after the start event. |
| [TryInsertBeforeActivity](IMicroflowService/TryInsertBeforeActivity.md)(…) | Inserts *activities* in a microflow directly before the *insertBeforeActivity*. This *insertBeforeActivity* must be connected in the microflow and must contain exactly 1 incoming [SequenceFlow](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/sequence-flow). |
| [UpdateActionAfterRename](IMicroflowService/UpdateActionAfterRename.md)(…) | When a variable is renamed, this method needs to be called to update all the usages and references to it. |
