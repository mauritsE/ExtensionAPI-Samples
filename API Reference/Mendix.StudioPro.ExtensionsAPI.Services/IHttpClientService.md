# IHttpClientService interface

Provides access to the HttpClientFactory from Studio Pro, which manages the usage of the HTTP Client Handler across the application. This prevents socket allocation exhaustion, which can cause undesirable application behavior.

```csharp
public interface IHttpClientService
```
